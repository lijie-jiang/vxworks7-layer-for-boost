## VxWorks&reg; 7 Recipe Layer for Boost

This repository contains a VxWorks&reg; 7 Source Build (VSB) layer. 
Add this layer to your VxWorks install to build and verify Boost as part of your board's VSB project.  

This repository contains a collection of patches to adapt Boost to VxWorks.
Boost is many libraries and not all of them will work with VxWorks, some of them require
C++ support not available in VxWorks, or are dependent on other libraries not available 
for VxWorks. The **vxworks7-boost** project goal is to validate as many Boost libraries
as possible and then push the required changes to boost.org. Until the patches are
incorporated into Boost they will exist here.

This layer does not contain Boost and only provides a recipe to adapt Boost to VxWorks. 
Boost is not part of any VxWorks product, and is not covered by your Wind River support agreement.
If you need help, use the resources available and boost.org, or contact your Wind River sales
representative to arrange for consulting services.

## Project License

The source code for this project is provided under the Boost Software License - Version 1.0 (BSL-1.0). Text for the BSL-1.0 and other applicable license notices can be found in the LICENSE_NOTICES.txt file in the project top level directory. Different files may be under different licenses. Each source file should include a license notice that designates the licensing terms for the respective file.

## Prerequisite(s)

Install the Wind River&reg; VxWorks&reg; 7 operating system from March 2017 or later.
The Boost layer has a dependency on the UNIX compatibility layer in this release;
***InstallDir*/vxworks-7/pkgs/os/utils/unix** 

If you are on a system **without internet conectivity** you must obtain the Boost sources and put them in: ***InstallDir*/vxworks-7/download**. On a Linux build host obtain these sources from http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.59.0/boost_1_59_0.tar.gz/download, and on Windows from http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.59.0/boost_1_59_0.zip/download. If you are online, these are downloaded by **wget** or **curl** during the build. 

The **expect** executable used for adapting the Boost test harness to cross compilation is not provided on Windows build hosts, and must be licensed separately, it has not been verified. It can be obtained from http://www.activestate.com/activetcl/expect. It is not required to build Boost, only to execute the test harness.

## Installation

1. Obtain the VxWorks Boost layer:
  *  Go to  https://github.com/Wind-River/vxworks7-layer-for-boost
  *  Download a zip of the layer using the link provided by GitHub.
	 ![](./docs/download.png)
  *	Unzip into your VxWorks install directory in an appropriate place in the packages directory, typically;
      ***InstallDir*/vxworks-7/pkgs/app**
	  
2. If you are using the Boost **streams** library you must obtain the **bzip2** layer and place it in your VxWorks 7 install in a similar manner: https://github.com/Wind-River/vxworks7-layer-for-bzip2 	  

## VxWorks Configuration and Build

Create a VSB project based on your BSP, with Workbench or from the command line. For example, on Linux: 	  

```
$ cd InstallDir
$ ./wrenv.linux –p vxworks-7
$ cd ../workspace
$ export WIND_WRTOOL_WORKSPACE=`pwd`
$ wrtool prj vsb create –bsp vxsim_linux simVSB
$ cd simVSB  
```

Or, on Windows:

```
$ cd InstallDir
$ wrenv -p vxworks-7
$ cd workspace
$ set WIND_WRTOOL_WORKSPACE=%cd%
$ wrtool prj vsb create –bsp vxsim_windows simVSB
$ cd simVSB
```

After creating the VSB (VxWorks source build project), include the BOOST layer using the Workbench configuration editor:
![](./docs/layer selection.png)

   The VSB build unpacks Boost into ***vsbDir*/3pp/BOOST**.
And copies the headers to ***vsbDir*/usr/h/public/boost**.
The buildable portions of Boost become visible selections in the Workbench configuration menu once the layer is enabled. 
![](./docs/wb_boost_menu.png)

   Only the Boost timer library is included by default, selecting the layer also installs the headers in the VSB.
Other libraries must be selected in the Workbench configuration tool before they are included. 
You can also select to build the portions of Boost you want on the command line (in Workbench) with **vxprj** or **wrtool**:
```
$ vxprj vsb add BOOST
$ vxprj vsb config -s -add "_WRS_CONFIG_BOOST_MATH=y"
$ make 
``` 
or 
```
$ wrtool prj vsb add BOOST
$ wrtool prj vsb value set BOOST_MATH y
$ make 
```
If you are using Workbench, you may want to turn off C++ indexing before you build the VSB, as the Boost libraries are large. Right-click on the VSB project name, select **Properties > C/C++ General > Indexer**, and un-check **Enable Indexer**. Click **Apply**, and **OK**.

The Makefile that actually builds the code is ***InstallDir*/vxworks-7/pkgs/app/boost/usr_src/vxworks.lib.mak**. This is copied to the Boost source directory, ***vsbDir*/3pp/BOOST/boost_1_59_0/**.

## b2 Usage
 
The initial build of the Boost layer creates the **vxworks_env.sh** which contains the current VSB cross build environment. This is propagated to the Boost jam build environment by the generic **project_config.jam** file provided in the Boost layer. Once these files are in place, you can optionally invoke the **b2** outside of the VSB build by first sourcing **vxworks_env.sh**.  Duplicate the command found in the build log. For example:

```
$ cd  3pp/BOOST/boost_1_59_0
$ . ./vxworks_env.sh 
$ ./b2 install --prefix=VSBDir/usr/root --libdir=VSBDir/usr/lib/common \
--includedir=VSBDir/usr/h/public  link=static  toolset=gcc cross-compile=vxworks     \
--with-atomic --with-chrono --with-context --with-coroutine --with-exception \
--with-test -q -d2
```

As a best practice, simply build the BOOST layer for incremental builds. 
```
$ vxprj vsb build BOOST
```
NOTE: The thread library has an additional dependency.
```
$ vxprj vsb config -s -add "_WRS_CONFIG_DEFAULT_PTHREAD_PRIO_INHERIT=y"
$ vxprj vsb config -s -add "_WRS_CONFIG_BOOST_THREAD=y"
``` 

## Testing 

Most of Boost is header only libraries. Therefore, to verify them with a specific VxWorks configuration, you must run regression tests for the library you wish to verify. All regression tests are dependent on the test harness library so it must be included first. For example:
``` 
$ vxprj vsb config -s -add "_WRS_CONFIG_BOOST_TESTS=y"
$ vxprj vsb config -s -add "_WRS_CONFIG_BOOST_MATH_TESTS=y"
```
The default behavior is to simply build the tests during the final VSB build stage.
To actually execute the tests after each one is built, specify the telnet address of your test system.
```
$ vxprj vsb config -s -add "BOOST_TELNET_ADDR=192.168.200.1"
```
The target's path to the workspace defaults to using the TCF path, but can be set to another method. 
```
$ vxprj vsb config -s  \
-add "_WRS_CONFIG_BOOST_HOST_FILEPATH_MAPPING_PREFIX=bkuhlfedora:"
```
The tests are executed by connecting to the target through Telnet using an expect script found in the Boost layer: **vxworks_boost_test_run.exp.** 
Or, for 64 bit Windows machines: **boost_test.exe.**

There is a *chicken and egg* problem here. You must create a VIP from the VSB before running the Boost tests, so it is necessary to build the VSB twice in order to run the tests. For example, execute the following in you workspace:

```
$ wrtool prj vsb create –bsp simVSB vxsim_linux
$ cd simVSB  
$ vxprj vsb add BOOST
$ vxprj vsb config -s -add "_WRS_CONFIG_BOOST_MATH=y"
$ make 
$ cd ..
$ wrtool prj vip create –vsb simVSB vxsim_linux gnu simVIP
$ cd simVIP 
$ vxprj component add INCLUDE_IPTELNETS
$ vxprj component add INCLUDE_PX_SCHED_DEF_POLICIES
$ vxprj component add 
$ vxprj build
$ sudo ../../wrenv.linux -p vxworks-7
> vxsimnetd –sv &
> exit
$ gnome-terminal -e "vxsim -netif simnet0=192.168.200.1 -f default/vxWorks"
$ cd .. 

$ cd simVSB  
$ vxprj vsb config -s -add "_WRS_CONFIG_BOOST_TESTS=y"
$ vxprj vsb config -s -add "_WRS_CONFIG_BOOST_MATH_TESTS=y"
$ vxprj vsb config -s -add "_WRS_CONFIG_BOOST_TELNET_ADDR=192.168.200.1"
$ vxprj vsb config -s -add  \
"_WRS_CONFIG_BOOST_HOST_FILEPATH_MAPPING_PREFIX=bkuhlfedora:"
$ make
```

**NOTE:** If you are running Windows, in the above commands, replace `wrenv.linux` with `wrenv` and `vxsim_linux` with `vxsim_windows`.

Test pass/failure results appear on the console; the results are also stored in the Boost build directory in 
***vsbDir*/3pp/BOOST/boost_1_59_0/bin.v2/libs/*library_name***.

### Testing with build_run_tests.sh
As an alterntive to running the Boost test harness within the VxWorks VSB build, a bash shell script is generated by the build that can be invoked independently once the Boost layer is built.
For example: 
```
$ wrtool prj vsb create –bsp simVSB vxsim_linux
$ cd simVSB  
$ vxprj vsb add BOOST
$ vxprj vsb config -s -add "_WRS_CONFIG_BOOST_MATH=y"
$ vxprj vsb config -s -add  \
"_WRS_CONFIG_BOOST_HOST_FILEPATH_MAPPING_PREFIX=bkuhlfedora:"
$ make 
$ cd ..
$ wrtool prj vip create –vsb simVSB vxsim_linux gnu simVIP
$ cd simVIP 
$ vxprj component add INCLUDE_IPTELNETS
$ vxprj component add INCLUDE_PX_SCHED_DEF_POLICIES
$ vxprj component add 
$ vxprj build
$ sudo ../../wrenv.linux -p vxworks-7
> vxsimnetd –sv &
> exit
$ gnome-terminal -e "vxsim -netif simnet0=192.168.200.1 -f default/vxWorks"
$ cd .. 

$ cd simVSB/3pp/BOOST/boost_1_59_0  
$ export BOOST_TELNET_ADDR=192.168.200.1"
$ ./build_run_tests.sh  --limit-tests=math
```

**NOTE:** If you are running Windows, in the above commands, replace `wrenv.linux` with `wrenv` and `vxsim_linux` with `vxsim_windows`.

This is a wrapper of the Boost **b2** command, and by default it tests the entire set of Boost libraries, even those that are unsupported. Therefore, the command should be invoked with options modifying the behavior for your testing requirments. For complete **b2** documetation, consult the Boost documetation at http://www.boost.org/build/doc/html/bbv2/overview/invocation.html. The following options are used by the VSB Boost layer but are not included in **build_run_tests.sh** :

| Option |   Behavior  | 
| ------ | ----------- |
| -q     |  quit after the first test failure |
| -d2    |  debug level 2, print command invocations |  
| testing.execute=off |  build tests only, do not execute |.
| --abbreviate-paths | munge the test directory names so they are shorter |
| --limit-tests=*library1*\|*library2* | only build and execute a subset of library tests |
| variant=release | build test executables without debug information |
| -j*Jobs* | run tests in parallel using *Jobs* threads |  

### Notes:
* The ***exceptions/copy_exception_test*** fails with the debugger attached. It launches thousands of threads and overwhelms the debugger and may require a longer timeout in the expect script to pass.
* Workbench users should disable source indexing for the VSB; otherwise java runs out of memory. 
* No clean rule is provided for the Boost layer, but cleaning the VSB will rebuild Boost as well. The download directory is not touched, so the rebuild begins from the unpack stage.
* Removing the ***vsbDir*/3pp/BOOST**  directory or  ***vsbDir*/3pp/BOOST/boost_1_59_0/bin.v2/libs/*library_name*** will incrementally rebuild Boost independent of the VSB.
* The boost library core tests fail if not executed with a target IP configured. The boost test harness does not properly deal with the “run fail” targets this library uses. 
* The number of make build threads used in the VSB build is propagated to the Boost build though the -j option. However, during the testing this means multiple Telnet sessions run concurrently on the target system, and may overwhelm the memory on the target system.   If you have unreproducible, odd errors, or out of memory errors like the one shown below, repeat the testing single threaded to confirm the test is not failing due to target resource limitations.
```
0x81e4b180 (iTest_random_generator): memPartAlloc: block too big 520 bytes (0x8 aligned) in partition 0xe27312a0
0x81e4b180 (iTest_random_generator): memPartAlloc: block too big 520 bytes (0x8 aligned) in partition 0xe27312a0
```

## Using Boost Libraries with RTP Applications

Your VSB configuration must include the Boost library support required for your RTP applications. While you can select individual layers for specific library support in addition to the required based BOOST and UNIX layers, Wind River recommends that you add and build all of them.  

If you are using Workbench, you may want to turn off C++ indexing before you build the VSB, as the Boost libraries are large. Right-click on the VSB project name, select **Properties > C/C++ General > Indexer**, and un-check **Enable Indexer**. Click **Apply**, and **OK**.  

Your VIP project (based on your VSB) does not require any special configuration with regard to Boost or standard VxWorks C++ support (which is included by default).  

For your RTP application project:
1. Create the project and base it on the VSB project.
2. Add your code to the project.
3. Add the link commands for the Boost libraries you are using. 
  * If you are using Workbench, select the RTP application project name, then **Properties > Build Properties > libraries**. For example, add: 
```
-lboost_timer 
-lunix
```
  * Click **Apply** and **OK**. 
4. Update the include paths. For example, using Workbench, select select the RTP application project name, then **Properties > Build Properties > Paths > Generate**. Click **Apply**, and **OK**.  
5. Build the RTP project.
